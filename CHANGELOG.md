# Changelog

English | [中文](./CHANGELOG.zh.md)

All notable changes to `copilot-design` are tracked in this file.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-07-25

### Features
- Synchronize 13 project-type routes and the July 25 Claude Design system-prompt snapshot, covering slides, mobile apps, wireframes, documents, animation, UI mockups, résumés, 3D objects, research, HTML email, color/type systems, diagrams, and fliers.
- Add specialized workflows for 3D objects, data science and visualization, design feedback, experiments, HTML email, maps, social media campaigns, trifold brochures, watercolor illustration, web research, landing pages, and additional export formats.
- Add starter components for timeline animation, charts and data overlays, document and file views, 3D scenes, browser/device shells, and major social platforms.

### Changed
- Merge upstream improvements into `deck-stage`, `image-slot`, design guidance, and project routing while preserving local native PowerPoint animations, tweak suggestions, design-system tooling, import flows, and video export.
- Record reproducible upstream-sync provenance and manifests, with tests that verify every project type and protect local feature overlays.

### Documentation
- Expand the English and Chinese capability overview for the new workflows and starter components.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- `make-a-deck`: clarify that text-capable image generation is not a reason to prefer it — HTML/CSS stays the default for structured and precise slide content, and generated imagery remains a supplement reserved for conceptual scenes, mascots, hero/section art, and genuine infographics (Chinese labels are welcome when an infographic is genuinely the right call).

## 1.1.0 - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- `generate-images`: update raster image guidance for modern image backends that can render text reliably, including Chinese / CJK, and route text-heavy infographics to HTML/CSS only when editability, exactness, or data binding matters.
- `make-a-deck`: align deck imagery guidance with text-capable image generation so generated slide infographics can include headings, labels, callouts, and Chinese copy when they do not need live editability or exact numeric binding.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-06-22

### Features
- Ship the portable `copilot-design` Agent Skill with the core design methodology, harness references for Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex, built-in design workflows, starter components, design-system tooling, and local import/export agents.
- Add `release-skills`, a reusable release workflow for version selection, multi-language changelogs, annotated tags, and GitHub Releases.
- Add local deck, document, PPTX, video, image-generation, Figma `.fig`, GitHub repo, HTML/CSS import, and design-system preview flows.

### Fixes
- `gen-pptx`: improve editable PowerPoint fidelity by rendering children in z-index order, propagating ancestor opacity through exported subtrees, rasterizing gradient overlays, preserving Unicode filenames, preserving line breaks, and guarding stuck captures with per-call timeouts.
- `make-a-deck`: document full-height slide wrappers so full-bleed slide content exports reliably.

### Documentation
- Document installation, local usage, design systems, import sources, deck/PPTX export, and the supported agent harnesses in the English and Chinese READMEs.

## 2026-06-19

### Features
- `generate-images`: add a harness-agnostic image-generation dispatcher and wire it into the design flows that need raster output. The dispatcher records prompt files before generation, chooses runtime-native providers before an installed general-purpose image backend, standardizes `imgs/` + `prompts/` outputs, and removes the obsolete `gemini-image` built-in skill.

### Changed
- PPTX export now defaults to editable mode; screenshot export remains available when explicitly requested.

### Fixes
- `make-a-deck`: document that each slide's content wrapper must fill its `<section>`. deck-stage sizes only the section (via `::slotted`), not the wrapper inside it, so a wrapper whose children are all absolutely positioned collapses to zero height — dropping full-bleed images entirely on export, or rendering hero backgrounds at half height. Adds a base CSS rule (`section[data-label] > *`), the mechanism behind it, and a verification check.
- `gen-pptx` / `gen-video`: preserve Unicode characters (CJK, Cyrillic, accented Latin) in export filenames via a shared `safeBasename` sanitizer, instead of replacing every non-ASCII word character with `_` (which turned names like `小米SU7-外观与价格` into all underscores).
- `gen-pptx`: rasterize CSS gradient backgrounds (cover/hero scrims, fade overlays) to transparent PNGs in editable PPTX export. PowerPoint has no gradient fill, so the converter previously flattened a gradient to its first color stop — turning an alpha-fading scrim like `linear-gradient(105deg, rgba(8,10,13,.92) → .05)` into a near-opaque dark rectangle that uniformly dimmed the whole image and hid the bright subject under the fade. The exporter now paints the gradient onto a canvas honoring each stop's alpha (linear + radial, angle / `to`-direction / corner, %/px stops, border-radius clipping), so overlays fade exactly as in the browser; unsupported forms (conic / repeating) fall back to the prior flat fill.

## 2026-06-16

### Features
- `animated-video`: add a local `gen-video` CLI for MP4/WebM/GIF export. It drives Chromium with Playwright, seeks timeline animations frame by frame through `window.__animStage`, supersamples captures, and streams frames to ffmpeg.
- `starter-components/animations.jsx`: add the `window.__animStage` timeline bridge and `?capture` behavior so exported animations start paused, render full-bleed, and omit editing chrome.

### Fixes
- `gen-pptx`: guard setup and capture calls with per-call timeouts so a stuck slide cannot hang export forever.
- `gen-pptx`: preserve code-block line breaks and `<br>` elements in editable PPTX text export.

### Documentation
- README: document the deck/PPTX export workflow and add English/Chinese pipeline diagrams.

## 2026-06-15

### Features
- `gen-pptx`: add a local PPTX exporter for Claude Code. The TypeScript CLI uses Playwright and PptxGenJS to export copilot-design decks in editable or screenshot mode and prints structured validation output.
- `deck-stage`: add native fullscreen support, auto-hide the thumbnail rail in Fullscreen API mode, add a fullscreen toolbar button plus `F` shortcut, and add a Duplicate slide action.
- `deck-stage`: move rail mutations to a host-driven `dc-op` model while preserving standalone HTML fallback behavior.
- `make-a-doc`: add a built-in skill for page-style, print-first documents.
- `something-cool`: add the opt-in "show me something cool" flow with an upfront direction picker.
- `tweaks-panel`: add `TweakSuggestionBar` so edit-mode tweak ideas can be dropped into the host chat composer.

### Changed
- Built-in skill prompts were refreshed across deck authoring, speaker notes, mobile prototypes, print/PDF export, handoff, PDF reading, visual design, animation, sound, Canva, and PPTX export flows.
- `design-canvas`: persist and restore viewport pan/zoom, with a visibility backstop and wheel passthrough for nested deck rails.
- `SKILL.md`: add PPT/PPTX/PowerPoint routing terms, scope PPTX export to copilot-design decks only, and trim the skill description under the runtime description limit.

### Fixes
- `deck-stage`: force slide animations and transitions to their end state during print/PDF export so entrance states are not captured mid-animation.

## 2026-06-11

### Features
- Add `import-from-github` and `import-from-html` built-in skills for treating repositories and existing HTML/CSS pages as design sources with provenance and content-is-data guardrails.
- Design-system tooling now parses component prop contracts from `.d.ts` files, emits complete enum/default prop guidance into `_ds_prompt.md`, and detects risky top-level Babel globals such as `status`, `open`, and `location`.
- Add a GitHub Actions test workflow and Node test coverage for the design-system, Figma import, preview, asset, and prompt tooling.

### Fixes
- `build-preview.mjs`: inline assets referenced from card scripts and JSX string literals so generated `preview.html` files no longer show broken images for script-side asset refs.
- `fig-materialize.mjs`: map font weights with the ordered decoder table so Semi Bold, Extra Bold, Thin, and related weights materialize correctly.
- `ds-prompt.mjs`: keep fenced JSX examples complete when extracting component prompt excerpts.

### Documentation
- README: add an "Import design sources" section covering offline Figma `.fig` files, GitHub repositories, and existing HTML/CSS references.

## 2026-06-10

### Features
- Add a local offline Figma `.fig` importer with `outline`, `mount`, `materialize`, `render`, and `design-system` subcommands.
- Add the `design-system-preview` built-in skill and `agents/build-preview.mjs`, generating a self-contained interactive `preview.html` for compiled design systems.

### Changed
- `.fig` importer output now prints copy-pasteable next-step commands, warns about case-insensitive filename collisions, and records mount/render guidance in generated README files.
- Design-system preview summaries are capped for very large systems so validation output stays readable.

### Fixes
- Design-system bundles now emit sources in dependency-safe order so local component dependencies are defined before consumers load.
- Token extraction no longer misreads BEM pseudo-class selectors as custom-property declarations.
- Preview fallback messages now distinguish a missing manifest from a manifest with no usable preview entries.

## 2026-06-09

### Features
- Add end-to-end design-system support: discovery, project binding, `_ds/<slug>/` sync, generated per-load `_ds_prompt.md`, and project metadata recorded in `_d_meta.json`.
- Add the read-only fork-verifier subagent for post-build checks across Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor harnesses.
- Design-system prompts now use bundle-first wiring, include component prompt excerpts, and expose PascalCase `.jsx`/`.tsx` exports without `.d.ts` contracts when safe.

### Changed
- Expand design-system authoring guidance for GitHub source import, component imports, accepted global CSS entry names, and runtime wiring.
- Shorten the `copilot-design` skill description while preserving trigger terms (by @easonshen90, #8).

### Credits
- `copilot-design` skill description shortening contributed by @easonshen90 (#8).

## 2026-06-08

### Features
- Add the portable design-system authoring toolchain: compiler, checker, core parser, vendored Babel runtime, and a read-only checker subagent.
- Add design-system consumer import/sync tooling, including `_ds/<slug>/` bindings, generated per-load prompts, and `_d_meta.json` project metadata.
- Add asset recording tooling for tracking generated deliverables, versions, status, viewport, subtitles, and sections.

### Changed
- Harness references now point to the shared design-system authoring guide and clarify when to run checks inline versus through an isolated read-only subagent.

### Fixes
- Remove the tracked `skills/copilot-design/.DS_Store` file (by @HCS9527, #2).

### Credits
- Tracked `.DS_Store` removal contributed by @HCS9527 (#2).

## 2026-06-07

### Fixes
- `SKILL.md`: fix frontmatter metadata so the skill loads correctly (by @y122972, #1).
- Remove the root `.DS_Store` file and add `.DS_Store` to `.gitignore`.
- Correct README screenshot file mappings.

### Documentation
- Add screenshots to the English and Chinese READMEs, document Reader Mac App prompts and Claude Design comparison examples, and optimize screenshot assets to WebP.

### Credits
- `SKILL.md` frontmatter fix contributed by @y122972 (#1).

## 2026-06-06

### Features
- Add the portable `copilot-design` Agent Skill with core design methodology, built-in skill prompts, starter components, export/handoff flows, and Claude Code/Cursor harness references.
- Add Codex Agent support with `skills/copilot-design/references/codex.md`, covering question asking, browser preview, screenshots, debugging, deliverable surfacing, and subagent verification defaults.

### Documentation
- Add English and Simplified Chinese README files.
- Add this changelog and clarify that final design/prototype delivery should surface the running preview, not only generated files.

### Chore
- Add initial repository files and MIT license.
